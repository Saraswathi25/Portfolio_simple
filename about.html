              Hello there! Welcome to my About Me page. My name is Saraswathi
              Jagadeesan, and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              I grew up in the vibrant city of Tiruchirapalli, where I spent my
              formative years exploring its rich culture and diverse community.
              My upbringing in this bustling city has greatly influenced my
              outlook on life and shaped my values.

              <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
              I am presently engaged in the pursuit of a postgraduate
              certificate program in Web Development at Conestoga College,
              located in Brantford.

              I pursued my education at K.Ramakrishnan college of Engineering,
              where I graduated with a degree in Electronics and Communication.
              My time there was filled with enriching experiences and
              opportunities for personal and academic growth.
